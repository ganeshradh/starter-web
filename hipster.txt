Secretary kicks off with the timid Lee being released from the hospital and back into the clutches of her dysfunctional life. In a desperate bid to avoid the patterns of unhappiness that have dominated her past, Lee takes her mother’s advice and enrols in secretarial school, and, upon completion, begins searching for a job. It’s at her first interview that she meets the mysterious E. Edward Grey (James Spader).

Mr Grey is a highly eccentric lawyer, with his own secret pastimes. As well as having an obsession with red marking pens, Edward has a severe secretary fetish and a heavy need for kink. After a brief interview, Edward hires Lee to ostensibly take care of his typing, filing, and coffee making. However, when his barely restrained desires get the better of him, the two oddbods are off and running in an office relationship like no other. Spanking, saddlewear, and sexual mind games meld with typing and photocopying as the pair skitter down an unusual path towards love.
